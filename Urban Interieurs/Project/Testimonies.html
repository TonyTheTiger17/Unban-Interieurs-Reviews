    <p> a fantastic job with my condo. Recommended blinds, which look fantastic, that I didn't even know existed. There was a very small manufacturing defect in one of the shades and it was replaced quickly with no hassle. As an owner he is very hands on, knowledgeable and accessible. His prices were also better than the competitors. I would highly recommended their services.

    <p>I would like to highly recomend Crystal Augustus to anyone looking for a designer who they can trust to produce a beautiful result in their home. I first saw Crystal's work at a friends home and was extremely impresed. I wanted to transform my sitting room and bring it up to date, but also have a room that would stand the test of time and have a touch of class and luxury. Crystal achieved this for me. She went above and beyond, advising on colours, textures and acessories. I am delighted wuth the result.

    <p>Having never worked with an Interior Designer previously, I was apprehensive contacting Aspire Design, concerned that we would end up with rooms that we did not feel comfortable in. However, within a few minutes of speaking with Jeronica Collins, all such concerns disappeared. Jeronica made it clear that she worked with her clients to ensure that the end result reflected their lifestyle and needs. At our first consultation, Jeronica took time with us to understood our requirements, e.g. curtains, blinds, upholstery,colours etc. that we liked. The Scheme she put together for us has created a calming oasis, which was exactly what we wanted to achieve, but would never have been able to do so ourselves. Jeronica was always available to consult with during the implementation phase of the design and answer any questions we had. Thanks to her and her excellent team we now have rooms which are a pleasure to be in. I could not recommend the services of Aspire Design and Louise highly enough to anybody thinking about re-decorating their home.
